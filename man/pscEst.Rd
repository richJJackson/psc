\description{
Function for performing estimation procedures in 'pscfit'
}
\details{
Define the set of model parameters \eqn{B} to contain \eqn{\Gamma} which summarize
the parameters of the CFM. Prior distributions are defined for B using a
multivariate normal distribution \eqn{\pi (B) ∼ MVN(\mu ,\Sigma)} where \eqn{\mu|}
is the vector of coefficient estimates from the validated model and \eqn{\Sigma}
is the variance-covariance matrix. This information is taken directly from the
outputs of the parametric model and no further elicitation is required.
The prior distirbution for the efficacy parameter (\eqn{\pi{(\beta)}}) is set
as an uniformative \eqn{~N(0,1000)}.

Ultimately the aim is to estimate the posterior distribution for \eqn{\beta} conditional
on the distribution of B and the observed data.  A full form for the posterior
distribution is then given as

\deqn{P(\beta \vert B,D) \propto L(D \vert B,\beta) \pi(B) \pi(\beta)}

Please see 'pscfit' for more details on liklihood formation.

For each iteration of the MCMC procedure, the following algorithm is performed \enumerate{

\item{Set and indicator s=1, and define an initial state based on prior
hyperparameters for \eqn{\pi(B)}  and \eqn{\pi(\beta)} such that \eqn{b_s = \mu and \tau_s=0}}

\item{Update \eqn{s = s+1} and draw model parameters \eqn{b_s} from \eqn{\pi(B)} and an draw a
proposal estimate of \eqn{\beta} from some target distribution}

\item{Estimate \eqn{\Gamma_(i,S)=\nu^T x_i} where \eqn{\nu} is the subset of parameters from \eqn{b_s}
 which relate to the model covariates and define 2 new likelihood functions
   \eqn{\Theta_(s,1)=L(D \vert B=b_s,\beta=\tau_(s-1) )} & \eqn{\Theta_(s,2)= L(D \vert B=b_s,\beta=\tau_s)}}

\item{Draw a single value \eqn{\psi} from a Uniform (0,1) distribution and estimate
the condition \eqn{\omega=  \Theta_(s,1)/\Theta_(s,2)}. If \eqn{\omega > \psi} then accept \eqn{\tau_s} as belonging
to the posterior distribution \eqn{P(\beta \vert B,D)} otherwise retain \eqn{\tau_(s-1)}}

\item{Repeat steps 2 – 4 for the required number of iterations}

}
The result of the algorithm is a posterior distribution for the log hazard ratio,
\eqn{\beta}, captures the variability in B through the defined priors \eqn{\pi{(\beta)}}.
