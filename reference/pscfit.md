# Personalised Synthetic Controls model fit

Function which allows comparison of a data cohort against a parametric
Counter Factual Model (CFM). The function allows models of the type
'flexsurvreg' and 'glm' to be supplied. The function performs by
calculating the linear predictor as a combination of the CFM and the
dataset supplied and then selects a likelihood based on the type of
model specified. Likelihood is estimated using a Baysian MCMC procedure
wherebey the parameters of the CFM acts as informative priors.

## Usage

``` r
pscfit(
  CFM,
  DC,
  nsim = 2000,
  id = NULL,
  trt = NULL,
  nchain = 2,
  thin = 2,
  burn = 500
)
```

## Arguments

- CFM:

  An R model object of class 'glm' or 'flexsurvspline'

- DC:

  A dataset including columns to match to covariates in the model

- nsim:

  The number of simulations for the MCMC routine

- id:

  Numeric vector stating which patient(s) from the dataset should be
  included in the analysis. Defaults to all patients

- trt:

  An optional vector denoting treatment allocations for multiple
  treatment comparisons. Defaults to NULL.

- nchain:

  Number of chains used in posterior MCMC estimation. Defaults to
  nchain=3.

- thin:

  Thin applied to posterior draws. Defaults to thin=2.

- burn:

  Number of posterior samples to use as burn-in. Defaults to burn=500

## Value

a object of class 'psc' with attributes model.type, the cleaned Dataset
and the posterior distribution of the fitted model

Attributes include

- A 'cleaned' dataset including extracted components of the CFM and the
  cleaned DC included in the procedure

- An object defining the class of model (and therefore the procedure
  applied - see above)

- A matrix containing the draws of the posterior distributions

## Details

Model currently supports estimation of more than one treatment (using
the 'trt') option and esitmation restricted to sub-groups of the data
cohort (using the 'id' option.

the `pscfit` function compares a dataset ('DC') against a parametric
model. This is done by selecting a likelihood which is identified by the
type of CFM that is supplied. At present, two types of model are
supported, a flexible parmaeteric survival model of type 'flexsurvreg'
and a geleneralised linear model of type 'glm'.

Where the CFM is of type 'flexsurvreg' the likeihood supplied is of the
form:

\$\$L(D \vert \Lambda, \Gamma_i) = \prod^{n}\_{i=1} f(t_i \vert \Lambda,
\Gamma_i)^{c_i} S(t_i\|\Lambda, \Gamma_i)^{(1-c_i)}\$\$

Where \\\Lambda\\ defines the cumulative baseline hazard function,
\\\Gamma\\ is the linear predictor and \\t\\ and \\c\\ are the event
time and indicator variables.

Where the CFM is of the type 'glm' the likelihood supplied is of the
form:

\$\$L(x \vert \Gamma_i) = \prod^{n}\_{i=1} b(x \vert \Gamma_i)
\exp{\\\Gamma_i^T t(x) - c(\Gamma_i)\\ } \$\$

Where \\b(.)\\, \\t(.)\\ and \\c(.)\\ represent the functions of the
exponential family. In both cases, \\\Gamma\\ is defined as:

\$\$\Gamma = \gamma x + \beta\$\$

Where \\\gamma\\ are the model coefficients supplied by the CFM and
\\\beta\\ is the parameter set to measure the difference between the CFM
and the DC.

Estimation is performed using a Bayesian MCMC procedure. Prior
distributions for \\\Gamma\\ (& \\\Lambda\\) are derived directly from
the model coefficients (mean and variance covariance matrix) or the CFM.
A bespoke MCMC routine is performed to estimate \\\beta\\. Please see
'?mcmc' for more detials.

For the standard example where the DC contains information from only a
single treatment, trt need not be specified. Where comparisons between
the CFM and multiple treatments are require, a covariate of treamtne
allocations must be specified sperately (using the 'trt' option).
