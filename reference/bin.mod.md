# Example model for a survival outcome

A generated model with a binary endpoint and a logistic link function.
Data for the model were synthetically generated and are based on a
dataset to evaulate the use of Sorafenib in HCC akin to the PROSASH
model (see ?psc::surv.mod for more details)

## Usage

``` r
bin.mod
```

## Format

A model of class 'glm':

- vi:

  vascular invasion

- ecog:

  ECOG performance Status

- logafp:

  AFP - log scale

- alb:

  albumin

- logcreat:

  Creatinine - log scale

- allmets:

  metastesis
